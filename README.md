*This repository was written for educational purposes and its contents, especially .ucf, .sym and .ngc files, shouldn't be distributed*

A program which displays a moving circle on a screen, behaving like a spirit level.

In order for this program to work properly, one has to be in possession of the following components:
- ISE Design Suite IDE
- Spartan-3E Starter Board
- ADXL345 accelerometer
- Two monitors:
  - one for regular uses, in this case, to display the app's contents and turn it on/off
  - another one for the display of the spirit level itself. This monitor should preferably have a resolution of 600x800

After loading the project in the IDE, one should use built-in iMPACT tool to program the board and display everything on the second monitor
